These NPCs are usually controlled by the game master in role-playing games or by artificial intelligence in a video game. The term NPC (Non-Playable Character) has become popular on social media, describing people who exhibit strange behaviors and defy the rules of the game.",
            "body2": "Just like Coca-Cola, the NPC calculator has its own secret formula for calculating the <strong>NPC Score</strong>. We can't tell you much about it because it would break the game, but essentially, it’s possible to determine if someone is an NPC based on their preferences, as these provide clues about their source code and help determine their NPC Score. So to find out the percentage, you just need to input a few personal characteristics, and NPC Calculator will calculate the percentage for you.",
            "body3": "The NPC Score is an indicator that helps us know if a person is an NPC or not. This score is a percentage, which describes if a person is a main character when their NPC Score is between 0% and 40%. A double agent if the indicator is between 41% and 59%. Or an NPC if the percentage is between 60% and 100%.",
