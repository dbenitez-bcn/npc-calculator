      "body1": "A <strong>non-playable character</strong> or NPC, short for Non-Playable Character, refers to characters that are not controlled by the player. These NPCs are usually controlled by the game master in role-playing games or by artificial intelligence in a video game. The term NPC (Non-Playable Character) has become popular on social media, describing people who exhibit strange behaviors and defy the rules of the game.",
      "body2": "The NPC calculator has its own secret formula to calculate the <strong>NPC Score</strong>. We can't tell you much about it because it would break the game, but essentially, the NPC score is calculated based on their preferences, hobbies, and characteristics, as these provide hints about their source code. So to find out their NPC percentage, you just need to enter a couple of personal characteristics, and the NPC Calculator will calculate the percentage for you.",
      "body3": "The NPC Score is an indicator that helps us know if a person would be an NPC or not. This score is a percentage that describes whether a person would be a main character, a double agent, or an NPC. The test is designed humorously. It is not a serious result and is made only for entertainment purposes.",
